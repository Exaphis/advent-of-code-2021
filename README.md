# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

code bad, yadda yadda. Each day's solution will be cleaned up a bit after my
leaderboard attempt before committing to this repo.

Run `setup_day.py` to get working on a specific day of Advent of Code 2021.
It creates a new folder called `day_<num>` and within it creates
`day_<num>.py` copied from `template.py` as well as `input.txt` for your
specific input.
